## Abstract

Railway safety monitoring through real-time object detection is critical for preventing accidents caused by foreign objects on railway infrastructure. This repository presents a comprehensive benchmark study of lightweight object detection models optimized for deployment on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, focusing on foreign object detection (FOD) in railway environments. We evaluate various YOLO-series models to determine the optimal performance-accuracy trade-off for real-time railway applications, considering computational constraints, power consumption, and deployment feasibility.

## üöÇ Motivation

### Application Necessity
- **Safety Critical**: Detection of foreign objects (plastic bags, debris, bird nests, balloons) on railway power lines and tracks
